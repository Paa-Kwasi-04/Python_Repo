Apologies for the misunderstanding. Here's a combined set of coding exercises, including the earlier ones, in a random order:

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter their name and age, and then prints out a message that says "Hello, <name>! You are <age> years old."

2. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, and then prints out their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

3. Write a program that asks the user to enter a temperature in Fahrenheit, and then converts it to Celsius using the formula C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9. The program should then print out the temperature in Celsius.

4. Write a program that asks the user to enter three integers, and then prints out the largest and smallest of the three numbers.

5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, and then checks whether it is positive, negative, or zero. The program should then print out a message indicating the result.

6. Write a program that asks the user to enter their age, and then checks whether they are eligible to vote or not. In most countries, the minimum voting age is 18.

7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of numbers and calculates their sum until the user enters a negative number. Use a do-while loop for this task.

8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a grade and prints the corresponding letter grade based on the following criteria:
   - 90-100: A
   - 80-89: B
   - 70-79: C
   - 60-69: D
   - Below 60: F

9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of numbers and calculates their sum, skipping any negative numbers using the continue statement.

10. Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, and then checks whether they are equal or not. If they are equal, the program should print out a message saying "The two numbers are equal." If they are not equal, the program should print out a message saying "The two numbers are not equal."

11. Write a program that asks the user to enter a year, and then checks whether it is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.

12. Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of numbers and calculates their sum, skipping any negative numbers using the continue statement.

13. Write a program that asks the user to enter their name and age, and then prints out a message that says "Hello, <name>! You are <age> years old."

14. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, and then checks whether it is positive or negative. If it is positive, print "The number is positive." If it is negative, print "The number is negative."

15. Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of numbers and calculates their sum until the user enters a number that is greater than 100 using a while loop and break statement.

16. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and prints the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10 using a while loop.

17. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but stops the loop and exits the program when it reaches a number divisible by 7 using the break statement.

18. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and checks whether it is positive or negative. If it is positive, print "The number is positive." If it is negative,

 print "The number is negative."

19. Write a program that asks the user to enter a year, and then checks whether it is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.

20. Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of numbers and calculates their sum, skipping any negative numbers using the continue statement.

Feel free to tackle these exercises in any order you prefer. Happy coding!
