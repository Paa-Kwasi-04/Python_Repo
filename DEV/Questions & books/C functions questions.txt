Sure! Here are a few coding problems for functions in C:

1. Problem: Write a function that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum.

2. Problem: Write a function that takes an integer as a parameter and returns true if it is a prime number, and false otherwise.

3. Problem: Write a function that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters, and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.

4. Problem: Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the length of the string.

5. Problem: Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns true if it is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and false otherwise.

6. Problem: Write a function that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters, and returns the maximum value in the array.

7. Problem: Write a function that takes two strings as parameters and returns true if they are anagrams (contain the same characters in any order), and false otherwise.

8. Problem: Write a function that takes a number as a parameter and returns the factorial of that number.

9. Problem: Write a function that takes a string as a parameter and returns the string in reverse order.

10. Problem: Write a function that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters, and sorts the array in ascending order.

These are just a few examples to get you started. You can modify them or create new ones based on your needs and interests. Happy coding!
