Flowcharts

A diagram that shows the 'flow' of steps in a program

Rounded rectangles - Terminals (Start, End)
Rectangles - Processes (Mathematical computations and variable assignment)
Parallelograms - Reading input and displaying output 
Diaomonds - Decision structures 

Four Flowchart structures
* Sequence - Normal linear flow 
* Decision - Actions taken depending on a condition 
* Repetition - Using a loop to reiterate a code
* Case - The switch case (large if-else structure)

In drawing flowcharts, they can sometimes occupy multiple pages.
In such a case, a circle is used to indicate a connector.

The symbol for functions is three rectangles side-by-side
