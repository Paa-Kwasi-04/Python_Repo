Sure! Here are 10 coding questions on arrays and structs in C:

Question 1:
Write a C program to find the sum of all elements in an integer array.

Question 2:
Given an integer array, write a C program to find the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

Question 3:
Implement a C program to reverse the elements of an integer array in place.

Question 4:
Write a C program to sort an integer array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

Question 5:
Given a struct representing a student with fields: name (string), age (integer), and grade (float), write a C program to find the student with the highest grade in an array of students.

Question 6:
Implement a C program to calculate the average of all the elements in an integer array.

Question 7:
Write a C program to remove duplicates from a sorted integer array. The program should modify the original array in place.

Question 8:
Given two integer arrays, write a C program to find the intersection of the two arrays (common elements) and store them in a new array.

Question 9:
Create a struct representing a book with fields: title (string), author (string), and year of publication (integer). Write a C program to find all books published after a given year in an array of books.

Question 10:
Given an array of integers, write a C program to move all zeros to the end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Remember to test your solutions with different inputs to ensure correctness. Good luck!
